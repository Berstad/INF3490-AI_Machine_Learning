# Python Introduction

## Running python interactive interpreter
After a successful install running python should be as simple as:
```
$ python
or
$ python3
```
On my machine:
```
$ python
Python 2.7.12 (default, Aug 20 2016, 13:01:52)
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 7.3.0 (clang-703.0.31)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```
As you can see I have python 2.7.12 installed currently. Type *exit()* to exit
the python interpreter. On UNIX systems EOF (Ctrl-D) also works.

I also have python 3.5.2 installed:
```
$ python3
Python 3.5.2 (default, Aug 20 2016, 14:09:43)
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 7.3.0 (clang-703.0.31)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

## Running python scripts
Run a python script by supplying the file name as a command line argument:
```
$ python test.py
or
$ python3 test.py
```
This will execute the script you have written in test.py!
